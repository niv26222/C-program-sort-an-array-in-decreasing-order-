using Array.Sort() and Array.Reverse() Method 





Different ways to sort an array in descending order in C#
An array is a group of like-typed variables that are referred to by a common name. And each data item is called an element of the array. Arranging the arrayâ€™s elements from largest to smallest is termed as sorting the array in descending order.

Examples:

Input : array = {5, 9, 1, 4, 6, 8};
Output : 9, 8, 6, 5, 4, 1

Input : array = {1, 9, 6, 7, 5, 9};
Output : 9 9 7 6 5 1

Input : array = {-8, 9, 7, 7, 0, 9, -9};
Output : 9 9 7 7 0 -8 -9
